        Phil - technical knowledge
    - How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
        We will communicate any issues we may encounter and ask each other for help whenever we need it
    - In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
        Abshir - React, MongoDb
        Phil - MongoDb, mongoose
    - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the 
      day-to-day development?
        Plan to meet to discuss the plan for the day, do a quick code review and ensure each team member understands the logic behind the goals for the day before beginning to code.
### Conflict Resolution
    -What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
        Communicate with each other to find out why that's happening and ask if there is anything the other could do to help out
    -What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member 
    contribute?
        Try to discuss amongst ourselves that one person is not getting to handle enough and if that doesnt work bring it up with a TA or instructor

    -How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is 
    impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
        Be patient with each other and offer help when it seems like someone doesn't understand the logic
